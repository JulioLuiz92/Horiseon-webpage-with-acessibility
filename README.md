# Horiseon-webpage-with-acessibility
This webpage has been modified to create acessibility, using semantic tags, in order to ensure that people with disabilities can access it using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.

In the process of code refactoring, the modifications consist to attend the criterias of:
find semantic HTML elements;
elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning;
find accessible alt attributes for icons and images;
heading attributes fall in sequential order;
existing title element with descriptive title.
